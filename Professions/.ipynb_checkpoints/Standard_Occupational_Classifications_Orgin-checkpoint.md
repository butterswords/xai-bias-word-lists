# Where did this data come from?

In looking for a solid list, I determined that the US Bureau of Labor Statistics would provide an excellent starting point for comprehensive listings of titles. This data can be found at [Standard Occupational Classifications in 2018](https://www.bls.gov/soc/2018/home.htm). Specifically, I made use of their [Direct Match Title File](https://www.bls.gov/soc/2018/home.htm#match), because it seemed to have the most comprehensive list and provided SOC categories.

Here's the Header from the file:
> U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics

> November 2017 (Updated April 15, 2020)
